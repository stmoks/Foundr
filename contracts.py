# The base code from the contracts portion of the platform. This module will inevitably have to be
# broken up into many others later but this is an adequate start. Contracts, I imagine, will make up 
# a big part of the platform. There are contracts that will have to exist between the artists, investors,
# investment platform, collaborating apps, payment systems, social media sites, tax authorities, and
# who knows who else.
