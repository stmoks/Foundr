The current codebase attempts to replicate parts of the Patreon codebase to create a platform for 
creators to show themselves. On top of that, the platform aims to give individuals the opportunity
to invest, similar to the stock market, in the artists they believe in. Not only does the artist benefit
from being able to start off their career, but the investors that believe in artists get to gain
from the profits.

Obviously, this is an ambitious idea that will require an incredible amount of work. But it is worth
the attempt and I believe I will thoroughly enjoy it.

Here we go.
